25-40 days band-pass filtered in-situ near-bottom current velocity in the Northeastern Pacific (10.5 degree north, 131.3 degree west)

Tropical instability waves (TIWs) were observed with around period of 32 days using a mooring observation in the northeastern Pacific. One mooring was deployed at 10.5°N, 131.3°W during 10 years as part of the Korea Deep Ocean Study (KODOS). The mooring was equipped with a current meter at a dpeth of ~5000m. Half-hour interval near-bottom current data were recorded from August 21, 2004 to July 27, 2013. To conduct the analysis about TIW, the data were filtered using a band-pass filter with periods of 25–40 days.
